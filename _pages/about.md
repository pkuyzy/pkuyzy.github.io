Hi! I'm Zuoyu Yan (严祚宇), a fourth-year Phd. student at Peking University, advised by [Prof. Zhi Tang](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/cpdp/kydw/ggcy/1297369.htm) and [Prof. Liangcai Gao](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/szwdclyjs/kydw/ggcy/1288880.htm). Before starting Phd., I finished my undergraduate study at the Yuanpei College of Peking University, majoring in Data Science.

**Research Interests:** My research interest lies in the intersection of graph representation learning and topological data analysis. In particular, I am interested in:
1. Learning topological representations
2. The expressive power of graph neural networks
3. Topological representation/graph representation acceleration

This is my [CV](/files/CV.pdf). If you are interested in my research, always feel free to contact me through my [e-mail](yanzuoyu3@pku.edu.cn).
