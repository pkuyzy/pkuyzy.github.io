Hi! I'm Zuoyu Yan (‰∏•Á•öÂÆá), a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Weill Medical College of Cornell University, working with [Prof. Fei Wang](https://weill.cornell.edu/faculty-highlight/fei-wang-phd).

I obtained my PhD degree from [Peking University](https://sai.pku.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Zhi Tang](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/cpdp/kydw/ggcy/1297369.htm) and [Prof. Liangcai Gao](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/szwdclyjs/kydw/ggcy/1288880.htm). During my Ph.D., I have also been fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Chao Chen](https://chaochen.github.io/), [Prof. Yusu Wang](http://yusu.belkin-wang.org/), [Prof. Tengfei Ma](https://sites.google.com/site/matf0123/home), and [Prof. Muhan Zhang](https://muhanzhang.github.io/).

Before starting Ph.D., I finished my undergraduate study at the [Yuanpei College of Peking University](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/aboutyuanpei/collegeprofile/index.htm), an exemplary high-quality and pioneering undergraduate college, majoring in Data Science.


**Research Interests:** My research interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and topological data analysis. In particular, I am interested in: 
1. Enhancing modern machine learning frameworks, e.g., graph neural networks, with topology/geometry.
2. Applying these models in real-world scenarios, e.g., biomedicine, and recommendation systems.

This is my [CV](/files/CV.pdf). If you are interested in my research, don't hesitate to get in touch with me through <zuy4001@med.cornell.edu>.
